I used Microsoft Purview to create a retention policy that applies to all SharePoint sites named "Short term...".

First I created a new SharePoint Site (Site Collection) called "Short term".

*I selected the "Team Site" template*

*I named the Site "Short term"*

## Data lifecycle management

I selected the data lifecycle management menu item, created the adaptive scope and then created the retention policy
