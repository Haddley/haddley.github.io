## Agents

Agents are systems that use LLMs as reasoning engines to determine which actions to take and the inputs to pass them. After executing actions, the results can be fed back into the LLM to determine whether more actions are needed, or whether it is okay to finish.

I created two LangChain Agents

I created a LangChain Agent that used Wikipedia 

I created a LangChain Agent that used DuckDuckGo and a Maths tool
