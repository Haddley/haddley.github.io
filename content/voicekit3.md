üéØ What This Code Does

This is a voice assistant program for Raspberry Pi (like a mini Google Assistant). When you say "OK Google", it listens to your commands and responds to them.

üîß How It Works - The Basic Flow

You say "OK Google" to wake it up
The LED lights up to show it's listening
You speak a command
It processes your command and responds
The LED changes to show what it's doing
üéµ The "Event Handler" - The Brain

The process_event function is like the brain that decides what to do:

```python
def process_event(assistant, led, event):
    # Different events trigger different actions:
    if event.type == EventType.ON_START_FINISHED:
        # Ready to listen
    elif event.type == EventType.ON_CONVERSATION_TURN_STARTED:
        # You started talking
    elif event.type == EventType.ON_RECOGNIZING_SPEECH_FINISHED:
        # It understood what you said - THIS IS WHERE WE ADD COMMANDS!
```

üÜï How We Added Extra Commands

We added special commands by creating functions and then connecting them to voice commands:

### Step 1: Create the Function

For each new command, we made a function that does the work:

```python
def get_temp():
    # Gets the temperature and returns a message
    return "My CPU temperature is 45 degrees Celsius"

def get_uptime():
    # Checks how long the system has been running
    return "The system has been up for 2 hours"
```
### Step 2: Connect to Voice Command

Then we connected these functions to specific voice commands:

```python
elif text == 'cpu temperature':
    assistant.stop_conversation()  # Stop Google from answering
    tts.say(get_temp())           # Use OUR function instead

elif text == 'uptime':
    assistant.stop_conversation()
    tts.say(get_uptime())
```

üìã The Commands We Added

Here are the new voice commands you can use:

| Voice Command | What It Does |
|---------------|--------------|
| "cpu temperature" | Tells you how hot the Raspberry Pi is |
| "uptime" | Says how long the system has been running |
| "public ip address" | Finds and tells your internet IP address |
| "usb devices" | Counts how many USB devices are connected |
| "system load" | Checks how busy the computer is |

üõ†Ô∏è How Each New Command Works

get_temp() - Runs a system command vcgencmd measure_temp to read temperature
get_uptime() - Uses uptime -p to get how long system has been on
get_public_ip() - Contacts websites like api.ipify.org to find your public IP
get_usb_devices() - Runs lsusb to list USB devices and counts them
get_system_load() - Uses uptime to see how busy the computer is
üéØ Key Points to Remember

assistant.stop_conversation() - This tells Google Assistant: "Don't handle this command, we'll handle it ourselves"
tts.say() - This makes the computer speak the response
Voice commands must match exactly what you programmed (like "cpu temperature")
So when you say "OK Google" followed by "cpu temperature", the program recognizes your command, stops Google from processing it, runs our special temperature function, and speaks the answer back to you! üé§‚û°Ô∏èü§ñ‚û°Ô∏èüîä

"""Run a recognizer using the Google Assistant Library.

The Google Assistant Library has direct access to the audio API, so this Python
code doesn't need to record audio. Hot word detection "OK, Google" is supported.

It is available for Raspberry Pi 2/3 only; Pi Zero is not supported.
