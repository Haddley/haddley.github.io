## Daybook sub-ledgers

In Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central, daybook sub-ledgers are used to record and manage specific types of transactions.

Each daybook sub-ledger corresponds to a specific type of transaction or business process.

Common daybook sub-ledgers include:

**Bank Sub-ledger**
A Bank Journal is used for recording transactions related to bank accounts. It includes entries for bank deposits, withdrawals, and other bank-related transactions.

**Sales Tax Sub-ledger**
A Sales Tax Journal is used for recording transactions related to bank accounts. It includes entries for bank deposits, withdrawals, and other bank-related transactions.

**Sales Sub-ledger**
A Sales Journal is used for recording sales transactions. This includes entries related to sales invoices, sales orders, and other sales-related activities.

**Purchase Sub-ledger**
A Purchase Journal is used for recording purchase transactions. It includes entries related to purchase invoices, purchase orders, and other procurement-related activities.

**Inventory Sub-ledger**
An Inventory Journal is used for recording inventory transactions. It includes entries related to adjustments, transfers, and other inventory-related activities.


## Posting Groups

In Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central, Posting Groups are a set of configuration settings that help determine how transactions are posted to the general ledger. Posting Groups are used to "build a bridge" between Business Central sub-ledgers and the general ledger accounts. 

Posting Groups are a crucial aspect of the system's configuration, allowing businesses to establish rules for how financial transactions will be recorded.

Common Posting Groups include:

**General Posting Group**
Used to link general ledger accounts to customers, vendors, items, and resources. This helps determine the accounts affected when recording transactions in sales, purchases, and general journal entries.

**Customer Posting Group**
Links customers to specific general ledger accounts. When a sales transaction occurs, the Customer Posting Group determines the accounts that will be affected in the general ledger.

**Vendor Posting Group**
Similar to the Customer Posting Group but used for vendors. It links vendors to specific general ledger accounts for purchase transactions.

**Inventory Posting Group**
Links items to specific general ledger accounts. It determines the accounts affected when dealing with inventory-related transactions, such as purchases and sales of goods.

**Resource Posting Group**
Used in resource-related transactions to link resources to specific general ledger accounts.

**Bank Account Posting Group**
Determines the default general ledger accounts associated with specific bank accounts. This is important for recording bank transactions.

**Fixed Asset Posting Group**
Links fixed assets to specific general ledger accounts. It determines how fixed asset transactions are recorded in the general ledger.

**VAT Posting Groups**
Used to determine the general ledger accounts affected by Value Added Tax (VAT) transactions. This is crucial for businesses operating in regions where VAT is applicable.

By setting up and configuring these Posting Groups, businesses can ensure that their financial transactions are consistently and accurately recorded in the general ledger.
