## Creating a VB.NET Web App project using Dotnet Command Line Interface (CLI) - Sort of

I am able to develop ASP.NET Core applications with the VB.NET language. However, creating a VB.NET ASP.NET Core application is not support by the dotnet command line app.

$ dotnet new web -lang VB -o haddley-web (fails)

$ dotnet new web -lang C# -o haddley-web (works)

*dotnet new web -lang VB -o haddley-web (fails)*

*dotnet new web -lang C# -o haddley-web (works)*


## VB.NET console app

As a workaround I can generate a VB.NET console application project and convert it to a VB.NET Web App project.

$ dotnet new console -lang VB -o haddley-console
$ cd haddley-console
$ dotnet new gitignore
$ dotnet run

*dotnet new console -lang VB -o haddley-console*

![](/assets/images/dotnet-core-part2-deleted/screen-shot-2023-03-15-at-2.25.13-pm-1140x316.png)
*dotnet run (the generated console application)*

*I updated the .vbproj file*

*I updated the Program.vb code from"Console.WriteLine(...)"*

*to "WebApplication.CreateBuilder(...)..."*

![](/assets/images/dotnet-core-part2-deleted/screen-shot-2023-03-15-at-2.38.17-pm-1476x522.png)
*dotnet run (the Web App)*
