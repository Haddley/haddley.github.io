## Sales Orders

In Dynamics 365 Business Central, a Sales Order is a document that represents a customer's intent to purchase goods or services from a company. It is a crucial component of the sales process and serves as a foundation for managing customer interactions, tracking orders, and fulfilling customer requests.
