## Anaconda install

I ran into a [documented issue](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/254786965) when I tried to install Anaconda on my Apple MacBook.

These install steps worked for me:

*I ran the Xcode setup "*xcode-select --install"

*I downloaded the anaconda [command line installer](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2023.03-MacOSX-arm64.sh).

I opened a Terminal and navigated to ~/Downloads**

I ran the downloaded script "Bash Anaconda3-2023.03-MacOSX-arm64.sh"
