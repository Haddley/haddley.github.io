## General Ledger

The General Ledger is fundamental to financial management and accounting within Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central.

Users update the General Ledger through the creation and posting of General Journal entries (or through the posting of documents using the document to journal to ledger pattern).

The General Ledger contains the balances of all accounts in the Chart of Accounts.

I created a Chart of Accounts from scratch and demonstrate how Journal entries can be used to record a Purchase transaction and a Sales transaction.

## Purchase

When we purchase items we will need to record the value of the items (a new asset), the money we owe to the vendor (a new liability) and the sales tax that we will claim back from the authorities.

I created a Finished Goods asset account that I could post the purchase value to.
I created an Accounts Payable, Domestic account that I could post the vendor liability to.
I created a Taxes Liable account that I could post the sales tax amounts to.

## Sale

When we sell items we will need to record the money our customer owes to us (a new asset), the revenue generated by the sale, the cost of the goods sold, and sales tax that we will be providing to the authorities

I created an Accounts Payable, Domestic account that I could post the vendor liability to.
I created a Resale of Goods account.
I created a Cost of Materials account.

The difference between Total Assets ($3,210) and Total Liabilities ($2,713) is **$497**; and
