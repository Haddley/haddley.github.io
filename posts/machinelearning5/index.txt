## Linear Regression

Can we predict a person's glucose levels based on their age?

If one thing depends on another thing in a linear way the least squares method can be used to predict the dependent thing (y) given the independent thing (x).

If there is a linear relationship between glucose levels and age we should be able to summarize that relationship using an equation of the form **y = mx + b**.

In this formula **y** would be the (predicted) thing (glucose level) and **x** would be the given thing (the person's age).

In this formula **m** is the slope of the linear relationship (weight) and **b** is the y-intercept constant (bias).

If a linear relationship exists and we can collect enough data we should be able to calculate the value of m and b and to predict the value of a person's glucose levels based on their age.

This [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_fu7gIikxY) explains how we can calculate the slope and y-intercept values by hand  using the least squares method.

As an exercise I wanted to use Excel and machine learning to calculate the line of best fit.


## Excel

Excel has built in "slope()" and "intercept()" functions that can be used to calculate the slope (m) and y-intercept (b) for a set of dependent and independent data points.

The youtube video referenced [above](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_fu7gIikxY) explains how these functions work.

## Calculating the line of best fit using the sklearn LinearRegression model

A Colab Notepad can be used to show data points and the line of best fit.

## Making a prediction

Once a model has been trained it can be used to make predictions.

In the example above we can provide a person's age and predict what their glucose level might be (based on the data used to train the model).

## A larger data set

[Plotly Sample Datasets](https://github.com/plotly/datasets) includes a larger diabetes dataset.

A Colab Notepad can used to show data points from the dataset and a description of the dataset.

## Excel

Again we can use Excel to calculate a line of best fit.
