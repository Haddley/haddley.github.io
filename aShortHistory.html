The acquisition, according to Microsoft, represents a major step in the company’s entry into the small and medium business applications market.<br><br>Drawing on Microsoft’s global scale and .NET platform technology and Great Plains’ expertise in business applications for small and medium companies, both corporations say they view this as an opportunity to help small and medium business be more efficient and agile by automating interconnected business processes, bridging the gap between on-premise software and next generation connected software and services. This is also an important part of Microsoft’s strategy to deliver the power of the .NET platform to small and medium companies. At the same time, Microsoft and Great Plains will create new opportunities for partners to grow their businesses by delivering and integrating next generation solutions that take advantage of the powerful .NET foundation for small and medium business applications that Microsoft and Great Plains will provide.<br>On the eve of the announcement, key strategists from both corporations — Group Vice President Jeff Raikes, of Microsoft’s Productivity and Business Services Group, and Great Plains’ CEO Doug Burgum — took a few moments to sit down with PressPass to discuss the intricacies of acquisition, the significance of the deal to small and medium companies and about the new opportunities this will create for existing Microsoft and Great Plains partners.<br></p>

These solutions expose and connect the specific activities, processes and reports people need for real jobs inside a company, whether they're the president, the finance manager, the warehouse worker or the support clerk. And they'll have the familiar look and feel people know from using Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office today," Ballmer wrote.<br><br>Microsoft will rebrand the core Microsoft Business Solutions products with the Dynamics name as new versions roll out next year. The grand plan is to roll four of the core products into one product in 2008, while offering Microsoft's CRM product both as part of the suite or separately.<br><br>In 2006 the product names will change from:<br><br>Microsoft CRM to Microsoft Dynamics CRM<br>Microsoft Business Solutions-Great Plains to Microsoft Dynamics GP<br>Microsoft Business Solutions-Axapta to Microsoft Dynamics AX<br>Microsoft Business Solutions-Navision to Microsoft Dynamics NAV<br>Microsoft Business Solutions-Solomon to Microsoft Dynamics SL.<br><br>The 2006 releases, called the wave 1 releases of Microsoft Dynamics, will include a more unified look and feel, contextual business intelligence, a greater emphasis on portals and increased integration with Web services.<br><br>Wave 2, in 2008, is supposed to deliver "best of" features and functionality of Axapta, Great Plains, Navision and Solomon. A separate version of Microsoft CRM that will be released in wave 2 will be available with or without the rest of Microsoft Dynamics.<br><br>To reduce the licensing uncertainty surrounding product consolidations, Microsoft is promoting a current licensing option called Transformational Assurance. "The Transitional Assurance benefit of the Enhancement Program is that when customers license Microsoft Business Solutions-Solomon, including the Standard editions, as well as Microsoft CRM, and stay current on the Microsoft Business Solutions Enhancement Program, they will be able to move to the future business application suite without having to reacquire the functionality they already license," Microsoft corporate vice president in the Microsoft Business Solutions Group Tami Reller said in a Q&amp;A posted on Microsoft's site.<br><br>Microsoft Business Solutions is one of seven divisions at Microsoft. The company will continue to refer to the division by that name internally. Microsoft will also keep the current names for the division's other products: Microsoft Point of Sale, Microsoft Retail Management System, Microsoft FRx and Microsoft C5.<br><br><a href="https://rcpmag.com/articles/2005/09/07/project-green-renamed-microsoft-dynamics.aspx" class="text-primary">https://rcpmag.com/articles/2005/09/07/project-green-renamed-microsoft-dynamics.aspx</a><br></p>

I still have a copy of this book about five feet from me, and while I haven’t opened the book in years it is a reminder of the early days of Dynamics CRM.<br><br>Dynamics 3.0 introduced the idea of XRM – CRM could be extended beyond simple contact and sales management. Instead, CRM 3.0 made customization simple but still not as simple as CRM today. While forms could be customized within the applications, Workflows were developed in an external Workflow manager that existed on the CRM server.</em><br><br><a href="https://www.encloud9.com/blog/dynamics-crm-personal-history/" class="text-primary" target="_blank">https://www.encloud9.com/blog/dynamics-crm-personal-history/</a><br></p>

In the six months since, over 124,000 users from 46,000 organizations in 143 countries have created web and mobile apps using PowerApps. We thank all of our preview users for their invaluable feedback, which has helped shape PowerApps into a better product.<br><br>Today, we are very happy to announce the general availability of PowerApps. PowerApps is ready for production use, across 6 regions and in 42 languages, with the 99.9% SLA customers expect from a Microsoft service.<br><br>In this release, we are pleased to announce a lot of new capabilities, and here are the key new features.<br><br>PowerApps Red heart SharePoint: fully integrated with SharePoint lists<br><br>In August, we started rolling out the preview of PowerApps integrated in SharePoint Online modern lists. You can create an app right from the command bar of a SharePoint Online custom list. That app then appears as a custom view of your SharePoint Online list, and users can access it both from the web as well as from the SharePoint Mobile app. This experience is now available to all SharePoint Online users. PowerApps also supports connecting to on-premises SharePoint lists for SharePoint 2013 and 2016 using the on-premises data gateway. Learn more about creating apps from SharePoint Online modern lists.<br><br>SPO-PowerApps<br><br>General availability of Common Data Service<br><br>With the general availability of PowerApps, Common Data Service is also now ready for global production use. Common Data Service is included as part of PowerApps plans and is the unifying backbone for your business data across PowerApps, Microsoft Flow, and pro-development tools. It provides an instantly available and scalable data store and a common data model with standard entity schema and behavior. It also provides a powerful data access layer with support for data import and export, security, and integration with Microsoft Office for Excel and Outlook. We’ll soon provide a software development kit (SDK) for professional development scenarios. We’ve incorporated lot of feedback from our preview users as well as from customers who are building business apps using Dynamics 365 and Office 365.

Today, we are excited to announce that Dynamics 365 is generally available.<br><br>The first thing users will see with Dynamics 365 is that we are bringing our business applications closer together in how they look, feel and integrate with each other. To better enable end-to-end business processes, we have unified the navigation and core user experience across each of the Dynamics 365 applications. It remains clean, beautiful, and familiar and it gives you the ability to seamlessly move from one application to another without switching windows.<br><br>...<br><br>Simple, consistent navigation is only the beginning.

PowerApps is the platform on which Dynamics 365 apps are natively built.  Model-driven apps provides a no-code or low-code component approach to app development. <br><br>Model-driven apps run with the new Unified Interface client which provides a responsive accessible design running in browsers and on popular mobile devices.  This app type composes multiple component types including dashboards, forms, views, charts, and business processes which together form a great UI.  If you are familiar with the Dynamics 365 platform, you are already familiar with the PowerApps platform and Model-driven Apps.<br><br>Both model-driven and canvas apps allow you to easily build business apps.  They both share access to the Common Data Service providing standard and custom entities.  Canvas apps start with your user experience, crafting a highly tailored interface with the power of a blank canvas and connecting it to 200 data sources. Canvas apps can be built for web, mobile, and tablet applications. Model-driven apps start with your data model – building up from the shape of your core business data and processes in the Common Data Service to model forms, views, and other components. Model-driven apps automatically generate great UI that is responsive across devices.<br></p>
