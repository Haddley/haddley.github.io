Power Apps (Part 14) Model Driven Purchase Order Lines This file is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license. Model Driven Purchase Order Lines I created a Power Platform Model Driven application to manage Business Central Purchase Order Lines. I set the General Section to 2 columns and moved the Quick View form into that section. I set the General Tab to be 1 column I added a new section below the General Section I added a Purchase Order Lines Subgrid to the New Section (with the Show related records checkbox selected). I hid the Section and Subgrid labels A row was added to the Subgrid for every Purchase Order Line. I navigated into the Business Central solution. I added the "All Purchase Order Lines" view to the solution I added the Amount Excluding Tax column to the All Purchase Order Lines view. I clicked the Save & Publish button I refreshed the Business Central app. I added all of the other available columns to the view. I clicked the Save & Publish button I refreshed the Business Central app. I clicked the + New Purchase Order Line button I clicked the Save button and the application generated an error.
