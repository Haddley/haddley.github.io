# Machine Learning (Part 3)

Machine Learning (Part 3) Creating models Tensorflow logo does not meet the threshold of originality needed for copyright protection, and is therefore in the public domain Teachable Machine Teachable Machine is a web-based tool that makes creating ( supervised ) machine learning ( classification ) models fast, easy, and accessible to everyone. No prerequisite machine learning knowledge required. I used Teachable Machines to create a squishmallows recognizing application based on TensorFlow.js New Image Project Add a third (classification) class rename the three classes (one class for each squishmallow) Use the Webcam button to create a set of images (for each squishmallow) Click the train model button Model training complete Use the preview window to test the model Download the model and sample web page Copy the sample web page to Visual Studio Code to test squish.html The application is 100% certain that the webcam is pointing at the Apple squishmallow. Squish app
