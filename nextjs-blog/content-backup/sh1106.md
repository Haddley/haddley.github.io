# Raspberry Pi SH1106

Raspberry Pi (Part 3) OLED display Raspberry Pi is a trademark of Raspberry Pi Ltd Raspberry Pi OLED display The Raspberry Pi can output text (and simple graphics) to an OLED display using Python. OLED wiring i2cdetect -y 1 Luma-OLED Driver I installed the Luma-OLED driver by following these instructions: https://luma-oled.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html I installed the driver with this command $ sudo -H pip3 install --upgrade luma.oled I enabled I2C communications using the raspi-config application $ sudo raspi-config Interface Options | I2C | enable ARM I2C i2c permissions I followed the steps described by Alexander RÃ¼edlinger to allow non-root users to access i2c devices (specifically the OLED display). 1) Create new user group called i2c: $ sudo groupadd i2c 2) Change the group ownership of /dev/i2c-1 to i2c: $ sudo chown :i2c /dev/i2c-1 3) Change the file permissions of the device /dev/i2c-1 so users of the i2c group can read and write to the device: $ sudo chmod g+rw /dev/i2c-1 4) Add your user to the group i2c: $ sudo usermod -aG i2c <username> Python code hello.py The hello.py code running on configured hardware Displaying an image on the OLED display I downloaded a stop sign image and updated the hello.py code to display the image on the OLED display. Stop sign stop_sign_display.py Using OpenCV and luma.oled to display video on the OLED display OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and functions that enable developers to perform various computer vision tasks, such as image and video processing, object detection, facial recognition, and feature extraction. I used the cv2 library to read frames from a dog video I downloaded from: https://pixabay.com/videos/puppy-dog-playful-beach-sand-play-4740/ Then I updated the code to send image captured by the webcam to the OLED display.
