# Business Central Admin Center

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central (Part 3) Admin Center By Microsoft , Public Domain The Business Central Administration Center The Business Central Administration Center (Admin Center) provides a portal for tenant administration. I used the Admin Center to create a development/sandbox environment. I used the Settings|Admin Center link to navigate to the Admin Center (portal). Notice that the Safari browser is not supported. I clicked on the "Production" Environment I clicked the Copy link I selected Sandbox environment type and entered "MySandbox" as the new environment name I clicked the Yes link "Copy Scheduled" The MySandbox environment was listed in the Environments tab as "Preparing" The Sandbox state was updated to "Active" I clicked the link I was able to switch between the Production and Sandbox environment References The Business Central Administration Center
