# Stable Diffusion

Jupyter (Part 2) Stable Diffusion Cameron Oelsen , BSD , via Wikimedia Commons Stable Diffusion Stable Diffusion is a deep learning, text-to-image model released in 2022 based on diffusion techniques. It is primarily used to generate detailed images conditioned on text descriptions. https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers "stableenv" environment I created an isolated Anaconda environment "stableenv" for my Stable Diffusion development. I created the stableenv environment (adding jupyterlab, ipykernel and ipywidgets) conda create --name stableenv jupyterlab ipykernel ipywidgets I activated the stableenv environment conda activate stableenv I added jupyter labs support to the environment ipython kernel install --user --name=stableenv I started the jupyter lab service jupyter lab I switched to the stableenv environment (kernel) I installed the stable diffusion pipeline dependencies (I could have used pip) !conda install -c conda-forge -y accelerate diffusers transformers I created a pipe instance using the DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(id) method call. The DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(id) method call returned a warning I generated an image using the pipeline In this configuration Stable Diffusion did not take advantage of the laptop's GPU. In this configuration Stable Diffusion took 4 minutes and 19 seconds to generate an image. I updated the pipeline instance to use the laptop's GPU In this configuration Stable Diffusion used the laptop's GPU. In this configuration Stable Diffusion took 1 minute and 7 seconds to generate an image. References Hugging Face CompVis/stable-diffusion
