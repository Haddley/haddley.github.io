# Machine Learning (Part 4)

Machine Learning (Part 4) Notebooks Tensorflow logo does not meet the threshold of originality needed for copyright protection, and is therefore in the public domain Colab Colab is Google's implementation of Jupyter Notebooks . A Colab consists of text comments and code NumPy NumPy is a Python library for creating and manipulating vectors and matrices. import numpy as np np.array([...]) np.array([[...],[...],...,[...]] a sequence from 5 to 11 6 random values between 50 and 100 5 random floating point values between 0 and 1 feature and label adding noise Pandas Pandas DataFrames are similar to spreadsheets. DataFrames have columns and rows. import numpy and pandas pd.DataFrame(data=<data cell values>, columns=<column names>) <dataframe>["<new column name>"] = <dataframe>["<existing column name>"] + <constant> <dataframe>[<start index>,<end index + 1>] <dataframe>.copy()
