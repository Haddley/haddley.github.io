## Augmented Reality

[WebXR](https://github.com/immersive-web) supports both Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR).

WebXR has replaced the [WebVR](WebVR.html) standard.


## Scene with markers

This scene includes two Augmented Reality markers.

A sphere is added to the camera output when the Hiro marker is recognised.

A dinosaur is added to the camera output when the '6' barcode marker is recognised.

For convenience the barcode marker can be added to a web page QR Code.
