## LM Studio

I used LM Studio to test Large Language Models (LLMs) on my laptop.

*Answer the following question by reasoning step by step. The cafeteria had 23 apples. If they used 20 for lunch, and bought 6 more, how many apples do they have?*


## System prompt

LM Studio allowed me to update the system prompt and prefix suffix settings (on the right of the user interface).
