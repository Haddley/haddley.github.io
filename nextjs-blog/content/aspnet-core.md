## Create Razor Pages with ASP.NET Core.

ASP.NET Core is a cross-platform framework for building Internet-connected apps.

Razor Pages is the preferred way to create page or form-based apps in ASP.NET Core. From the docs, "Razor Pages can make coding page-focused scenarios easier and more productive than using controllers and views."

I used Visual Studio 2022 and ASP.NET Core to create a todo app.

## Page and PageModel

Razor pages include HTML markup and are similar to MVC views.

Razor PageModel classes are combination of MVC controllers and models. 

The OnGet() method below is executed when a browser sends a GET request to the server.

An OnPost() method is executed when a browser sends a POST request to the server.

*I updated the PageModel to include a message property set in the OnGet() method*

![](/assets/images/asp.net core/capturec-09-963x233.png)
*I updated the corresponding Razor page to include the Message.*

![](/assets/images/asp.net core/capturec-10-1357x635.png)
*I tested the Web application*

![](/assets/images/asp.net core/capturec-11-353x40.png)
*I created a Data folder to hold classes generated by Entity framework.*

![](/assets/images/asp.net core/capturec-15-1008x468.png)
*I wanted Entity framework to generate the classes needed to access and update the contents of a todo items database.*

![](/assets/images/asp.net core/capturec-16-1357x262.png)
*I installed the dotnet-ef (entity framework) tool*

![](/assets/images/asp.net core/capturec-17-1352x271.png)
*I needed to add a references to the Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design and Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer packages.*

![](/assets/images/asp.net core/capturec-19-1366x663.png)
*I ran the dotnet ef dbcontext scaffold... command to generate the entity framework related classes.*

![](/assets/images/asp.net core/capturec-20-1366x663.png)
*The Item class describes a database table row.*

![](/assets/images/asp.net core/capturec-22-363x44.png)
*I created a ToDo folder in the Pages folder.*

![](/assets/images/asp.net core/capturec-23-828x721.png)
*I right clicked on the ToDo folder and selected the Add | New Scaffolded Item... menu item*

![](/assets/images/asp.net core/capturec-25-656x442.png)
*I selected the Entity framework classes I generated eariler.*

![](/assets/images/asp.net core/capturec-26-468x137.png)
*I watched the progress bar*

![](/assets/images/asp.net core/capturec-27-408x200.png)
*I ran into an odd issue related to the Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Design package that was already installed. I reinstalled and tried again.*

![](/assets/images/asp.net core/capturec-28-1366x658.png)
*The CRUD Razor pages were generated.*

![](/assets/images/asp.net core/capturec-29-1330x436.png)
*I updated Program.cs to include a reference to ToDoContext...*

![](/assets/images/asp.net core/capturec-30-1364x317.png)
*...and ran the Web app by navigating to /ToDo*

![](/assets/images/asp.net core/capturec-31-1366x417.png)
*I used the create page to create a ToDo item.*

![](/assets/images/asp.net core/capturec-32-1366x363.png)
*The create page's OnPostAsync() method added the new item (using entity framework) and redirected me back to the ToDo index page.*

![](/assets/images/asp.net core/capturec-33-1362x308.png)
*I updated the appsettings.json file to include the database connection string.*

![](/assets/images/asp.net core/capturec-34-1366x514.png)
*I updated Program.cs to include a reference to the appsettings value.*

![](/assets/images/asp.net core/capturec-35-1361x516.png)
*I updated the ToDoContext class's OnModelCreating() method (removing the hardcoded connection string).*
