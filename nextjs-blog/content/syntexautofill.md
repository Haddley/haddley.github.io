Syntex Autofill is an AI feature in SharePoint that automatically extracts or generates metadata from documents using natural language prompts, populating SharePoint columns without manual entry. Syntex Autofill transforms unstructured content into structured data.

I added a **Smoke?** Autofill column to a Document Library. The objective was to automatically label [patient medical reports](langchain.html).

*I uploaded a patient medical report to a SharePoint Document Library. I clicked the + Add column button. I added a Smoke? column. I enabled the Autofill feature for this column. I added the Does the patient smoke? prompt.*
