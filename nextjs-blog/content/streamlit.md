**ChatGPT: What is Streamlit?**

Streamlit is an open-source Python library that allows developers to create web applications for data science and machine learning projects with minimal effort. It was designed to simplify the process of turning data scripts into interactive web applications without the need for extensive web development knowledge.

With Streamlit, you can create interactive web applications directly from Python scripts using familiar Python programming paradigms. The library is particularly popular in the data science and machine learning communities due to its ease of use and fast prototyping capabilities.
