## Spring Tool Suite

Spring Tool Suite is an Integrated Development Environment based on Eclipse.

Maven is a build and dependency management tool for Java.

The pom.xml file is used to maintain a list of modules that the Spring application depends on.

Module jar files are downloaded from a managed repository.

## React client

Static files can be added to the /src/main/resources/static folder of the Spring Boot project.

The static files can be image files, html files and javascript files.

The static files can be a [React](reactusestateuseeffect.html) app that calls the REST API exposed by the (same) Spring Boot project.
