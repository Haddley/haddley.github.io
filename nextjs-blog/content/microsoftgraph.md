## Graph Explorer

[Microsoft Graph](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/overview) is a REST API that can be used to access: Microsoft 365, Azure Active Directory, Windows and Dynamics 365.

[Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/graph-explorer) is a developer tool that allows a developer to make Microsoft Graph REST API requests and view corresponding responses.

## Graph Explorer permissions

Before the Graph Explorer is able to retrieve email messages using Microsoft Graph the user (or an administrator) has to provide consent. The user is agreeing that the client application (Graph Explorer in this case) can access parts of the Microsoft Graph on their behalf.

## Teams/SharePoint Online/One Drive files

Microsoft Teams channels include a "Files" tab.

Files uploaded to the Team's channel are stored in SharePoint Online.

All files uploaded to all public channels are stored in a shared Document Library in a Team specific SharePoint Online Site (Site Collection).

This SharePoint online Document Library can also be accessed using the One Drive application.
