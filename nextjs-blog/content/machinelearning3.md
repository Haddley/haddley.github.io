# Machine Learning (Part 3)

## Creating models

## Teachable Machine

[Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com) is a web-based tool that makes creating ([supervised](machineLearning1.html)) machine learning ([classification](https://www.edureka.co/blog/classification-in-machine-learning/)) models fast, easy, and accessible to everyone. No prerequisite machine learning knowledge required.

I used Teachable Machines to create a [squishmallows](https://squishmallows.com/) recognizing application based on TensorFlow.js

*New Image Project*

*Add a third (classification) class*

*rename the three classes (one class for each squishmallow)*

*Use the Webcam button to create a set of images (for each squishmallow)*

*Click the train model button*

*Model training complete*

*Use the preview window to test the model*

*Download the model and sample web page*

![](/assets/images/machinelearning3/screen-shot-2022-06-05-at-7.59.46-pm-1836x881.png)
*Copy the sample web page to Visual Studio Code to test*

*The application is 100% certain that the webcam is pointing at the Apple squishmallow.*
