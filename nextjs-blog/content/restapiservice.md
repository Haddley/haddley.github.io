## HTTP Methods/Verbs

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) defines a set of request methods that a client application will use to ask an HTTP server to do something. HTTP request methods are often called verbs. HTTP verbs include:

**Get **A client application will use a Get method to retrieve something from an HTTP server. 
                        **Post **A client application will use a Post method to send something to an HTTP server.
                        **Put **A client application will use a Put method to request that something managed by an HTTP server is updated.**Delete** A client application will use the Delete method to request that something managed by an HTTP server is thrown away.


## API Routes

Routing determines how an HTTP server will respond to a client request. The client application will specify a path and an HTTP verb.

Route parameters are passed as part of the URL provided to the HTTP server.

https://localhost/books
request details of all books

https://localhost/books/1788395549
request details of the book with ISBN Number 1788395549


## Route handlers and Response methods

Route handlers are functions that execute on the HTTP server when a request is received from the client application.

Response methods are used to send something back to the client application. Response methods include:

**send() **Sends a response to the client.

                        **sendFile() **Sends a file to the client.

**redirect() **Redirects the request.

**json()** Sends a JavaScript object to the client.

**status()** Sets the HTTP status code


## Using Node.js and Express

npm can be used to initialise a REST API project.

$ mkdir books
$ cd books
$ npm init
$ npm i express


## The package.json file

The package.json file generated by npm should be updated to:


## The index.js file

The index.js file generated by npm should be updated to:


## The Dockerfile

Visual Studio Code is able to add a Dockerfile to a Node.js project automagically.

Open the Command Palette (⇧⌘P) and use the "Docker: Add Docker Files to Workspace..." command:

FROM node:12.18-alpine

ENV NODE_ENV=production

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY ["package.json", "package-lock.json*", "npm-shrinkwrap.json*", "./"]

RUN npm install --production --silent && mv node_modules ../

COPY . .

EXPOSE 5000

CMD ["npm", "start"]

## Example route handlers

```javascript
app.get('/books', (request, response) => {
    response.json(books);
});

app.get('/books/:id', (request, response) => {
    const isbnId = Number(request.params.id);
    const found = books.find((book) => book.id === isbnId);

    if (!found) {
        response.status(404).send('Book Not Found');
    } else {
        response.json(found);
    }
});
```

## package.json

```javascript
{
  "name": "books",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1"
  }
}
```

## index.js

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
let books = [
    {
        "id": 1788395549,
        "title": "Learning Node.js Development",
    },
    {
        "id": 1788620216,
        "title": "Hands-On Microservices with Node.js",
    }
];

app.get('/books', (request, response) => {
    response.json(books);
});

app.get('/books/:id', (request, response) => {
    const isbnId = Number(request.params.id);
    const found = books.find((book) => book.id === isbnId);

    if (!found) {
        response.status(404).send('Book Not Found');
    } else {
        response.json(found);
    }
});


app.listen(5000, () => console.log('server running'));
```
