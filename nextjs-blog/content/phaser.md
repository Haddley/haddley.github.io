## Getting Started

A [getting started sample](https://haddley.github.io/phaser/index.html) includes a config object, a preload function and a create function.

The preload function is used to load the Phaser assets.

The create function is used to add assets to the scene/game.

## Aquarium

I created an animated [Aquarium](https://haddley.github.io/aquarium/index.html) based on [https://github.com/lrusso/Aquarium](https://github.com/lrusso/Aquarium).

The Aquarium code includes a config object, a preload function, a create function and an update function.

Again the preload function is used to load the Phaser assets.

Again the create function is used to add assets to the scene/game.

Here the update function is called (over and over again) as the main/game loop runs. 

The update function animates the scene (moving the fish and the bubbles).
