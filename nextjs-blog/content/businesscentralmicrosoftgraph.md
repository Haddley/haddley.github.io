## Microsoft Graph

[Microsoft Graph](MicrosoftGraph.html) can be used to develop applications that securely access and integrate with the data stored in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central.

Graph Explorer is a web-based tool provided by Microsoft that allows developers and users to interact with Microsoft Graph APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) without the need for writing code.
