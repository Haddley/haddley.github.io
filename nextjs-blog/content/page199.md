## A Business Central Customer Portal

Microsoft Power Pages is a low-code platform designed to build, host, and manage external-facing business websites.

Microsoft Dynamics Business Central provides an end-to-end solution for financials, sales, service, and operations. 

A Customer Portal is a software interface that gives customers complete visibility into their interactions with a company. It provides a platform for customers to track key metrics, support requests, or other information such as reference documents that can be easily shared.
