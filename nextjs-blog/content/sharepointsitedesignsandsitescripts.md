## Site scripts

Microsoft site scripts allow users and administrators to automate the provisioning of "similar" SharePoint sites.

Site scripts are JSON formatted files. 

Site scripts include "actions" that will modify a SharePoint site. 

Site script actions include:

Add Nav Link
**Apply Theme****Create Content Type****Create Site Column****Create SharePoint List****Install Solution****Join Hub Site****Remove Nav Link****Set Regional Settings****Set Site Branding****Set Site Logo****Set Site External Sharing Capability****Trigger Flow**


## The full schema can be downloaded from here

## Add-SPOSiteScript

Site scripts are added to a SharePoint tenant using the Add-SPOSiteScript command

## Applying a site design to an existing site

The Get-SPOSiteDesign command can be used to list the installed Site designs (and the ids assigned).

Site designs can be applied to an existing SharePoint site using the Invoke-SPOSiteDesign command.
