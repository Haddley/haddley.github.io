## Recursion

*When a function is called, the computer must "remember" the place it was called from... so that it can return to that location with the result once the call is complete. Typically, this information is saved on the call stack... For tail calls, there is no need to remember the caller...*

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call)

Some interpreters (and compilers) eliminate the stack frame creation and destruction work when they recognize tail recursion.

Create a folder for the *new* node module.

$ mkdir haddley-factorial-cc
