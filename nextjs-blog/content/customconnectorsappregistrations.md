# Power Apps, Custom Connectors and Application Registrations

## Creating a Custom Connector

To create a PowerApps Azure Active Directory Custom Connector the following values must be provided:

**Client id
Client secret**; and
**Resource URL**

*Custom Connector OAuth 2.0 Active Directory settings*


## The Custom Connector is the Client Application

In OAuth 2 an application accesses a resource on behalf of a user. 

In OAuth 2 the application does **not** store the user's username and password.

When setting up a Power Apps Custom Connector that will allow a user to access an API Service the Client Application is the Custom Connector and the Resource (Application) is the API Service.

Only three values are needed to create a Power Apps Custom Connector.

The three values needed to create a Power Apps Custom Connector are: the **Client id **(the client application registration ID), the **Client secret **(password); and the **Resource URL **(the resource application registration ID)

Here I will extend the [Vanilla JavaScript single-page application (SPA) using MSAL.js to authorize users for calling a protected web API on Azure AD](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-javascript-tutorial/tree/main/3-Authorization-II/1-call-api) tutorial to show how to configure a Power Apps Custom Connector using Azure application registrations.

## A JavaScript tutorial using MSAL

The [Vanilla JavaScript single-page application (SPA) using MSAL.js to authorize users for calling a protected web API on Azure AD](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-javascript-tutorial/tree/main/3-Authorization-II/1-call-api) tutorial demonstrates how to configure Azure Application Registrations for an API and for a Single Page Web Application (SPA) that calls an Application Programming Interface Service (API).

I cloned the git repository using this command:

```bash
% git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-javascript-tutorial.git
```

## Resource application registration

Before updating the Application Programming Interface (API) Service I needed to create the **resource application registration**.

![](/assets/images/customconnectorsappregistrations/screen-shot-2021-08-08-at-11.44.28-am-1704x396.png)
*Create the resource application registration*

![](/assets/images/customconnectorsappregistrations/screen-shot-2021-08-08-at-11.45.27-am-1704x1642.png)
*Provide the resource name*

![](/assets/images/customconnectorsappregistrations/screen-shot-2021-08-08-at-11.46.24-am-1062x294.png)
*Copy the "Application (client) ID" value.*


## Resource URL

The "Application (client) ID" value from the resource application registration is the **Resource URL** value we will need later to create the custom connector.

*The resource must provide at least one scope*

![](/assets/images/customconnectorsappregistrations/screen-shot-2021-08-08-at-12.17.38-pm-1702x1634.png)
*I added the "access_as_user" scope.*

![](/assets/images/customconnectorsappregistrations/screen-shot-2021-08-08-at-12.18.33-pm-1708x1630.png)
*The application registration manifest provides a way to export and update application registration settings.*

*The sample API code has been updated to include the tenantID and the clientID.*


## Client application registration

If I was following the [Vanilla JavaScript single-page application (SPA) using MSAL.js to authorize users for calling a protected web API on Azure AD](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-javascript-tutorial/tree/main/3-Authorization-II/1-call-api) tutorial I would create the client application registration for a Single Page Application (SPA) next.

Instead I will create a client application registration for the Power Apps Custom Connector.

![](/assets/images/customconnectorsappregistrations/screen-shot-2021-08-09-at-6.25.12-pm-1194x166.png)
*Copy the Application (client) ID*


## Client id

The "Application (client) ID" value from the **client application registration** is the **Client id** we will need later to create the custom connector.

## Client secret

The generated "Value" is the **Client secret** we will need to create the custom connector.

## Enterprise Applications

A service principal is created in each tenant where the application is used.

The service principle in each tenant references the globally unique application registration.

The service principal defines what the app can do in the specific tenant, who can access the app, and what resources the app can access.

The service principal objects are what you see when you select the Enterprise applications page.
