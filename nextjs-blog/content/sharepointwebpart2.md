## Adding the big calendar

npm is the package manager for the Node JavaScript platform. 

The npmjs web site is a repository of reusable software components.

react-big-calendar is an events calendar  component built for React.

[https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-big-calendar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-big-calendar)

To add the react-big-calendar component to our SharePoint Web Part solution we run this command:

$ npm i react-big-calendar


## Update the Calendar Function Component

This is how to update the Web Part's Calendar Component to include react-big-calendar.

Notice that we are again using React's [useEffect and useState hooks](reactusestateuseeffect.html).


## Pnp react-calendar sample

SharePoint provides a [REST API](restapiservice.html).

The [pnp react-calendar sample project](https://github.com/pnp/sp-dev-fx-webparts/tree/master/samples/react-calendar) uses an "sp-services" class to hold all of the code needed to fetch Calendar list items from the SharePoint site via SharePoint's REST API.

We can use the same approach:


## workbench.aspx

The code above assumes that your SharePoint site has a Calendar list named "Calendar".

The Local Workbench used for Web Part testing does not have a Calendar list, so to test the Web Part we need to navigate to the workbench page in a SharePoint site that does have a Calendar list (eg. https://haddleyoffice365.sharepoint.com/sites/AllStaff/_layouts/15/workbench.aspx).

## Packaging and deploying

These commands can be used to create a .sppkg package

gulp clean
gulp bundle --ship
gulp package-solution --ship

The Web Part can then be deployed by copying the .sppkg package to the SharePoint tenant's app catalog site.
