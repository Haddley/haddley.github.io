## Sub-ledgers

In Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central, sub-ledgers are used to record and manage specific types of transactions.

Each sub-ledger corresponds to a specific type of transaction or business process.

Sub-ledgers include:

Item Ledger
Vendor Ledger
Detailed Vendor Ledger
Customer Ledger; and
Detailed Customer Ledger


## Posting Groups

In Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central, Posting Groups are used to "build a bridge" between Business Central sub-ledgers and the general ledger accounts.


## Vendor Posting Group

A Vendor Posting Group is used to define which accounts payable general ledger account to use when purchasing goods from a Vendor.

A Vendor Posting Group can also be used to define service charge accounts, and payment discount accounts.

Vendor Posting Groups are maintained using the Vendor Posting Groups page.
