## 🔧 Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- npm

### Local Development
```bash
cd nextjs-blog
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the blog locally.

### Building for Production
```bash
cd nextjs-blog

# Standard build
npm run build

# Build with automatic classification
npm run build:classify
```

### Smart Classification
```bash
cd nextjs-blog

# Run classification analysis (no changes)
npm run classify:review

# Apply high-confidence classifications
npm run classify
```

### Deployment
Deployment is automatic via GitHub Actions when pushing to the `main` branch. The workflow:
1. Builds the Next.js application
2. Exports static files
3. Deploys to GitHub Pages

## 📝 Adding New Posts

1. Create a new `.md` file in `nextjs-blog/content/`
2. Add frontmatter with title, description, date, and tags
3. Write your content in Markdown
4. Run `npm run classify` to auto-categorize (optional)
5. Commit and push - deployment is automatic!

Example frontmatter:
```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
description: "Brief description of the post"
date: "2025-09-21"
image: "/assets/images/your-post/hero.png"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
---
```

**Note**: Categories are now automatically assigned by the smart classification system based on content analysis. You can manually override by adding `categories: ["Category1", "Category2"]` to the frontmatter.
